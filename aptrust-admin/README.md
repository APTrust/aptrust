aptrust-admin
============
Before running the web app you must first build all the dependent projects. To accomplish this first step see the README.md in the root directory of the aptrust project.

Once you've built the whole project: you can run the web admin by simply running the following:

  mvn clean jetty:run

on the command line and then open your browser to 

  http://localhost:8888/aptrust-admin/
